A lightweight and responsive Quality-of-Life addon for World of Warcraft: Classic Hunters.

BeastAndBow solves two core problems: constantly checking your inventory for ammunition/food, and quickly finding the nearest vendor in any zone.

## Key Features (v1.0.1)

* **⚡ Real-Time Tracking:** Tracks total available Arrows/Bullets across your inventory, bags, and quivers.
* **🔫 Dynamic Ammunition UI:** The dedicated vendor button and icon automatically switch based on your equipped weapon (Bow/Crossbow ➡️ Arrows | Gun ➡️ Bullets).
* **🚨 Visual Warnings:** Provides clear color warnings (Green/Yellow/Red) when your ammunition is running low.
* **🍖 Pet Food Finder:** Find the nearest vendor for all pet food types (Meat, Fish, Bread, Cheese, Fungus/Mushrooms, Fruits).
* **🗺️ Vendor Locator:** Integration with TomTom to set a direct waypoint to the nearest accessible ammunition or food vendor based on your faction and location.
